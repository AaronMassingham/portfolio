After giving a single page brief, we awaited initial design options, and when they came in, immediately knew we had made the right choice in off loading the project to a professional. We knew we could trust his artistic direction completely, and after we had confirmed our more detailed requirements, we had very little critical input left to do. Aaron hit all the milestones on time, with fabulous attention to detail, and the whole process was a pleasure. We love our new site, it delivers our brand identity effortlessly, and is snappy and responsive across all platforms.",

I created a new Wordpress theme from scratch, utilising my favourite plugin Advanced Custom Fields, which would give the client more control over adding content without the need for understanding design principles through the wysiwyg editor. The new site, which was designed and built in 2020 is fully responsive and sits neatly within the Graft Haus brand.</p><p>This was one of the last SSR websites that I built before looking more seriously into JavaScript and React. Although the client is currently very pleased with the website, I&apos;m hoping to get the opportunity to rebuild the frontend with Next JS and use WordPress as a headless CMS in the future to improve performance and security.</p>",

Throughout the initial stages I collaborated with other members of the team and reviewed market research to help me produce user flow sheets, wireframes and design sprints. Mapping every aspect of the design ready for handover to the dev team taught me a great deal about the value of exhaustive planning before executing a project of this scale.</p><p>Overall I modernised the Vitfor logo, established a new colour scheme, designed the UI for the web app, then designed and built the point-of-sale website using the same tech stack as the web app so that everything sat nicely within the project ecosystem. This was my first major leap from Gatsby JS to Next JS and also a first for me working with TypeScript, Chakra UI and Styled-components. One library I did bring to the table was Framer Motion, which I used to implement page transitions as well as scroll-based and SVG animations for a more fluid UX.</p><p>This was my first time working on such an extensive project and collaborating with a team as a freelancer, meaning this has easily become one of the most fulfilling projects I&apos;ve ever worked on. I look forward to lending my hand with further development on this project in the future.</p>",
