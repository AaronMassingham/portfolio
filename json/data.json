                "<p>I&apos;m a designer and jamstack developer working towards a skillset in frontend development. I&apos;ve been a designer since 2012 when I started working as part of a team of five for an agency in North Yorkshire, Wonder Media. During this time I established myself as a designer, learned a bunch and fine tuned my creative flow to accommodate for commercial projects.</p> <p>Around 2016 I took on a role as multimedia specialist at Pemco Creative, a company that specialised in corporate onboarding and eLearning for large construction companies like Morgan Sindall, Vinci Construction, and I&apos;Anson. My employment at Pemco helped me grow a broader understanding of UI design and UX principles including an interest in development. Soon enough I was converting my designs into clean, responsive front end code with other developers within the company. </p> <p>In 2019 I became a freelancer and went back to my roots, working with smaller businesses to produce clean user friendly content managed websites. This was about the same time that JavaScript grabbed hold of me and I have been building my understanding of JavaScript as a programming language ever since. My skillset now allows me to design high fidelity, wireframes, websites and UI designs then build them into scalable and performant static sites with React JS and JavaScript frameworks.</p>"

After giving a single page brief, we awaited initial design options, and when they came in, immediately knew we had made the right choice in off loading the project to a professional. We knew we could trust his artistic direction completely, and after we had confirmed our more detailed requirements, we had very little critical input left to do. Aaron hit all the milestones on time, with fabulous attention to detail, and the whole process was a pleasure. We love our new site, it delivers our brand identity effortlessly, and is snappy and responsive across all platforms.",

Once a comprehensive list was made, I got to work producing wireframes and designs for their review. We had a couple of meetings to discuss any alterations and I moved swiftly on to the development phase.

He suggested that I separated the website from WordPress to stop issues like this happening in the future and I decided to go for a full rebuild because the old site was getting pretty old. I already knew that Aaron had what it takes to help me out because he'd worked with me on a couple of other side projects in the past, so I knew I could trust his judgement. Aaron worked his butt off and didn't disappoint! The new website is far better than my old one and it fits nicely with the style of my barbershop. I'd highly recommend him to anyone when it comes to any design work. Great lad!",
